## If you still do not have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, please create it!

### Next steps do only once:
- create a repo with name `js-pro-course` - this repo will be a container for all of your future homeworks;
- create a `README.md` file with the repo description (write down your name there, add any additional info);
- add your mentor as a contributor:
  - [Daniil Suleiman](https://github.com/sulemanof)
  - [Aliaksei Astafyeu](https://github.com/tr3v3r)
  - [Dzmitry Martyniuyk](https://github.com/jathpr)
- create a `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig` files in the root (read more about this files [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/));

### Next steps do in every homework:

- **every homework should be started in a new branch in this repo with the name of lecture**;
- create a folder with the name of lecture;
- commit files into this folder, try make commits on every feature you did (read the article - [How to name a commit](https://habr.com/ru/post/183646/));
- when the homework is done, push your changes to the remote branch with the same name;
- create a `pull request` from your branch into `master` branch, add your mentor as a reviewer;
